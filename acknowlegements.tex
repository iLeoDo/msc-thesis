I would like to give my deepest gratitude to my project supervisor Prof. Min Chen, who offered me great help and guidance throughout the entire project. Every time I have a problem, he always explain to me patiently and support me all the time.

I would also like to express my gratefulness to my lecturers Prof. James Worrell, Dr. Andrew Ker, Prof. Gavin Lowe, Prof. Stephen Pulman and Prof. Nando de Freitas. Thank them for taught me knowledges in many different areas and trained me necessary skills for completing this project.

Meanwhile, I really appreciate my dear family and friends. It's they who gave me long-term support and assistance in this hardworking and fulfilling year in Oxford. Finally, I want to thank myself. For so many years, harbouring the faith of developing elite into a habit, I am always challenging and beyond myself to realise my dream. Hope I won't forget my initial determination and keep going.
